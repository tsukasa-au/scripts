# scripts
Set of shell scripts to make my life easier, all of which are too small for their own repo.

## Installation instructions

The easiest way is to grab the current version of the git-clone tool, then use that to bootstrap the repo onto the local machine.

```shell
python \
  <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsukasa-au/scripts/master/git-tools/git-clone) \
  git@github.com:tsukasa-au/scripts.git
```
